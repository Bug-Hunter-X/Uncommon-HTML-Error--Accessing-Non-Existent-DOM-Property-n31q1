This repository demonstrates a relatively uncommon error in HTML that can occur when interacting with the DOM. The bug involves attempting to access a property on a DOM element that does not exist. This often happens due to typos, incorrect assumptions about the structure of the DOM, or changes to the structure during runtime.

The `bug.html` file showcases the error. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version which includes robust checks for property existence to prevent the error.

This is a useful illustration of the importance of defensive programming when working with the DOM, especially in larger and more complex applications.
